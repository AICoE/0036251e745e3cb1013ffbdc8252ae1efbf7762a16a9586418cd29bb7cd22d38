## Initial Target Project List

We want to focus our effort on a small list of projects, that we think we can help to a high degree.

### Selection Criteria

* focus on Fedora SIG with a lot of packages, as this might indicate a relative importance to Fedora
* just C or Python language projects
* relevance of the SIG to Red Hat Enterprise Linux or OpenShift
* projects should be medium active, as this might indicate that we can focuse spares resources, and show our value
